# host-side waitForLoginTag override (called from start_and_wait after
# startVM + openConsole, before the default waitForText fires).
#
# Ubuntu cloud images boot to a serial getty, but the arch/console plumbing
# makes OCR/console-text matching fragile (especially under aarch64 TCG).
# Since prepareImage already baked SSH access into the qcow2, we poll the
# slirp hostfwd port on 127.0.0.1:$VM_SSH_PORT until sshd actually answers.
#
# IMPORTANT: do NOT probe with a bare TCP connect (e.g. `echo > /dev/tcp/...`).
# slirp's `hostfwd` makes QEMU listen on the HOST port the moment it starts,
# completing the host-side 3-way handshake well before the guest kernel has
# even POSTed. A bare TCP probe therefore returns "open" immediately and we
# fall through to the real ssh phase against a guest that's nowhere near up.
# Probe with `ssh ... exit` so the test only succeeds when the GUEST sshd
# actually answers (which under TCG aarch64 / riscv64 on a 2-core GHA runner
# can take 10-20 minutes after QEMU launch).
